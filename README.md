An easy weather app that lets you know how it feels outside.

This is my first API project, inspired by San Francisco's fickle weather. 
Often the actual temperature in SF is decieving and I was sick of leaving the house underdressed. 
My goal was to create an easy to use app that lets you know what it actually feels like outside.

I used the Weather Underground API to pull the current conditions based on zipcode and updated the page to reflect what it feels like.
The page loads using autodetect IP to guess your location, but it isn't always accurate so I added the input area for your zipcode.

The original project is full-stack and will be added to the google play store soon, however I've created a frontend only implementation specifically for this repo.

The site was developed using vanilla Javascript.
